    "Data were collected from three different sources.\n",
    "- First:- data was collected from the “twitter-archive-enhanced.csv” file which was in the same directory in which project notebook was located. The csv file was imported into pandas dataframe `twitter_archive`.\n",
    "- Second:- data was extracted programmatically from a URL:\n",
    "   https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image\n",
    "  predictions/image-predictions.tsv. Python’s request library was used to extract data from URL and save it to a file .this file was imported as a dataframe in pandas `image_predictions`.\n",
    "- Third:- data was extracted from Twitter API using python’s tweepy library. I needed to extract the favourites and retweet counts for each tweet. This data was then saved as a JSON file."
